# anti-derivative-distortion
code relating to integrating clipping functions and using finite difference to suppress aliasing

## Matlab script notes
Earlier versions of MATLAB take umbridge with defining functions in the same file as a script.
Should you encounter any problems, cut and paste the functions at the end of scripts into a seprate document.

All Matlab scripts written on macOS MATLAB 9.1.0.441655 (R2016b)
